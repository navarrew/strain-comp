Unwinds dsDNA until it encounters a Chi (crossover hotspot instigator) sequence from the 3' direction. Cuts ssDNA a few nucleotides 3' to the Chi site. The properties and activities of the enzyme are changed at Chi. The Chi-altered holoenzyme produces a long 3'-ssDNA overhang and facilitates RecA-binding to the ssDNA for homologous DNA recombination and repair. Holoenzyme degrades any linearized DNA that is unable to undergo homologous recombination. In the holoenzyme this subunit has ssDNA-dependent ATPase and 5'-3' helicase activity.

The properties and activities of the enzyme are changed at Chi. The Chi-altered holoenzyme produces a long 3'-ssDNA overhang and facilitates RecA-binding to the ssDNA for homologous DNA recombination and repair. Holoenzyme degrades any linearized DNA that is unable to undergo homologous recombination. In the holoenzyme this subunit has ssDNA-dependent ATPase and 5'-3' helicase activity.

In the presence of GTP, binds a polymerization-competent form of FtsZ in a 1 1 ratio, thus inhibiting FtsZ polymerization and therefore preventing it from participating in the assembly of the Z ring. This mechanism prevents the premature segregation of damaged DNA to daughter cells during cell division"

Then the PB-activated substrate is nucleophilically attacked by the selenol anion of component PA to transform it to a carboxymethylated selenoether and the respective amine. By action of component PC, acetyl phosphate is formed, leaving component PA in its oxidized state. Finally component PA becomes reduced by the thioredoxin system to start a new catalytic cycle of reductive deamination"

332MV	S	"One of the components of the core complex of photosystem II (PSII), required for its stability and or assembly. PSII is a light-driven water plastoquinone oxidoreductase that uses light energy to abstract electrons from H(2)O, generating O(2) and a proton gradient subsequently used for ATP formation. It consists of a core antenna complex that captures photons, and an electron transfer chain that converts photonic excitation into a charge separation"
